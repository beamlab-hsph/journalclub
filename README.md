# Great papers in the history of artificial intelligence
We are reading through some of the great papers in the history of artificial intelligence. The reading list is intentionally broad pulling from computer science, mathematics, philosophy, lingustics, and cognitive science, and we have a preference for older papers (i.e. written before the year 2000).


## Journal club papers to date
- Paper: __An Inductive Inference Machine__ <br />
  Author(s): Ray Solmonoff <br />
  Year: 1956 <br />
  Date: July 14th, 2020 <br />
  Presenter: Joe Hakim <br />

  Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14whQ2ZuEjGtz2hRvwvHKhj6eGbzKWRABUjeFxn7RhKM/edit?usp=sharing<br />
  __tl;dr:__ A description of an algorithm that can perform prediction on grids of numbers and operations. Works by using prior examples and specific transformations thereof to produce predictions favoring 'utility' and 'consistency'. Some brief philosophical discussion towards making the algorithm more "AI-like" and theoretical properties. <br />
  __Important because:__ Early (earliest?), truly probabilistic treatment of machine learning. <br />
- Paper: __Generalization of Pattern Recognition in a Self-Organizing System__ <br />
  Authors: WA Clark, BG Farley  <br />
  Year: 1955 <br />
  Date: August 11th, 2020 <br />
