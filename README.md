# Important papers in the history of artificial intelligence
We are reading through some of the great papers in the history of artificial intelligence. The reading list is intentionally broad pulling from computer science, mathematics, philosophy, lingustics, and cognitive science, and we have a preference for older papers (i.e. written before the year 2000). The only other selection criterion is they have to be shortish papers (< 15 pages), so sorry, no books! The goal is broad understanding of the research that forms the foundations for present day AI, and an a deeper understanding of the context in which each paper was written. 


## Journal club papers to date
- Paper: __An Inductive Inference Machine__ <br />
  Author(s): Ray Solmonoff <br />
  Year: 1956 <br />
  Date: July 14th, 2020 <br />
  Presenter: Joe Hakim <br />
  Link: http://raysolomonoff.com/publications/indinf56.pdf <br />
  Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14whQ2ZuEjGtz2hRvwvHKhj6eGbzKWRABUjeFxn7RhKM/edit?usp=sharing<br />
  __tl;dr:__ A description of an algorithm that can perform prediction on grids of numbers and operations. Works by using prior examples and specific transformations thereof to produce predictions favoring 'utility' and 'consistency'. Some brief philosophical discussion towards making the algorithm more "AI-like" and theoretical properties. <br />
  __Important because:__ Early (earliest?), truly probabilistic treatment of machine learning. <br />
- Paper: __Generalization of Pattern Recognition in a Self-Organizing System__ <br />
  Authors: WA Clark, BG Farley  <br />
  Year: 1955 <br />
  Date: August 11th, 2020 <br />
  Presenter: Eric Chen <br />

  __tl;dr:__ Clark and Farley present two experiments on the application of neural nets to the generalization of pattern recognition. The first experiment demonstrates that the net can be successfully trained (“organized”) on input patterns subjected to random variation, while the second experiment demonstrates that a trained net can successfully classify new input sequences into three classes based on observed behavior. The authors use many techniques that are similar to modern machine learning techniques.  <br />
  __Important because:__ Early application of neural nets to the generalization of pattern recognition/classification; precursor to modern machine learning techniques (noise injection, data augmentation, model ensembles)<br />
